# LAX county CHIME models

This repositoy contains various versions of the [CHIME model](https://github.com/CodeForPhilly/chime) re-written in R / Shiny. This includes
- A generic version of the CHIME model (rChime)
- A stochastic version of CHIME where the inputs are random (sChime)
In the future, we plan on adding data driven versions of the model.


## Getting Started

This project was developed in R version 3.5.1 (Feather Spray).  To install the primary dependencies run source/setup.R

the demos/ folder contains scripts that produce versions of the output outside of the shiny apps.  
- basicSIR_demo.R contains a minimum working example of the chime model
- stochasticSIR_demo.R contains a minimum working exanple of the stochastic chime model
